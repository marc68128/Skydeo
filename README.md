# Skydeo
This sofware is used to transfer video from any action cameras (like GoPro) to a debriefing computer. 
For this first version, the software will only allow one group of skydivers to register for each day. If there is more than one group, you will have to use serveral instances of the sofware.

## How it works 

### Video transfer.
Before each jumping days, all skydivers have to connect their camera to register for the jumping day. 
After each jumps, all skydivers will connect their camera and the software will automatically copy all new videos to the computer and asign them to the current jump. 

### Debriefing.
When skydivers want to debrif their jumps they can go to the debriefing screen and filter videos by day, jump or skydivers.
